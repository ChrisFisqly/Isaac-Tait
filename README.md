### - 🏔 My personal portfolio site (it is a work in progress):
<p>From my backyard I can see a long dormant volcano. When I first started my journey towards learning to write code I would sit outside and work on my laptop while my two year old son
would play. I would often stare up at that volcano and imagine myself conquering it and standing on the summit. Throughout my life I have had many spiritual and personal mountain top moments, where I would overcome adversity, uncertainty, or uncover a surprising truth. As I dove deeper and deeper into coding I realized that I was having a lot of mini mountain top moments. When I solved a complex coding challenges or I rooted out pesky bugs I would feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment... And just like that I came up with the name for my portfolio site.
</p>
<p>Living life in the pursuit of only mountain tops though can be dangerous though. We should use the mountain top experiences in our life to strengthen us while we are in the deep and dark valleys, where the sky may be just a sliver of the expanse we crave.

  <i>"When we are in an unhealthy condition either physically or emotionally, we always look for thrills in life.[..] in our emotional life it leads to obsessions and to the destruction of our morality; and in our spiritual life, if we insist on pursuing only thrills, it will result in the destruction of our spirituality." - Oswald Chamber</i>

### - 🌋 A few of my quirks: 
1) I am totally opposed to, abhor, and cannot tolerate contractions...
2) If I need a mid afternoon coding break (a.k.a. a nap 😴) I set a timer for 27 minute 12 second...
3) I got very excited when I met the requirements to up-vote on Stack Overflow...
